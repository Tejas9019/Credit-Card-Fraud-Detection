<i>"FraudShield: Detection of Fraud in Credit Card based on Machine Learning Techniques with integration of web-based Framework" this project is based on fraud detection of credit cards.</i> Basically, we implemented the Machine Learning techniques to detect such as like Logistic Regression, Decision tree, Naive Bayes, KNN and implemented comparison graph where we compare them on the accuracy and precision. So, by this graph we can find out that which model is suitable for detecting the frauds. And also, this has been implemented with web framework by making use of Streamlit.
